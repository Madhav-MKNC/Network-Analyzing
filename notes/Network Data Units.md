<h1>Overview of Network Data Units</h1>
<p>In computer networking, data is transmitted in discrete units called <strong>Network Data Units (NDUs)</strong>. These units help to ensure that data is transmitted efficiently and reliably across the network. In this overview, we will discuss the different types of NDUs and their characteristics.</p>
<h2>Types of Network Data Units</h2>
<h3>1. Bit</h3>
<p>The smallest unit of data in a computer network is a <strong>bit</strong>. It can have a value of either 0 or 1.</p>
<h3>2. Byte</h3>
<p>A <strong>byte</strong> is a unit of data that consists of 8 bits. It is the basic building block of most computer systems and is used to represent characters, numbers, and other types of data.</p>
<h3>3. Packet</h3>
<p>A <strong>packet</strong> is a unit of data that is transmitted across a network. It consists of a header and a payload. The header contains information about the packet, such as its source and destination addresses, while the payload contains the actual data being transmitted.</p>
<h3>4. Frame</h3>
<p>A <strong>frame</strong> is a unit of data that is used in local area networks (LANs). It consists of a header, data, and a trailer. The header and trailer contain information about the frame, such as its source and destination addresses, while the data contains the actual information being transmitted.</p>
<h3>5. Segment</h3>
<p>A <strong>segment</strong> is a unit of data that is used in transport layer protocols, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). It consists of a header and data. The header contains information about the segment, such as its source and destination ports, while the data contains the actual information being transmitted.</p>
